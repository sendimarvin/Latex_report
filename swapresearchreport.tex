			\section{Abstract}

				The different methodologies are to be used with brief procedures on how supporters can change to a team of interest probably soccer team without being noticed by fellow supporters.
Our methodologies provided in this document are also proven to be working by different people all around the nation wide. A reader is required to read carefully as some methodologies could lead to a violent behavior in the community hence any reactions taken from your actions are not to be blamed by the writer (choose what a methodology of interest wisely).

			\section{Introduction}

				There have been reported cases on social media where most funs have been insulting other funs, a most common scenario is one involving arsenal funs hiding in “kamoli” in whatsapp groups and not replying when live arsenal matches are being discussed.
In some dialogs with some of the supporters, most of them have been accusing there team managers (arsen wenger) for buying young, expensive and weak players in the team and also blame their team manager for coming up with weak team formations when they are playing big teams while others being straight open during interviews that they want a second team probably changing a team to support, listed are the different methodologies and briefly described below are the different procedures on how one can swap a team of support without being noticed.

			\section{Methodologies}

				One most efficient way of swapping a team without fellow supporters noticing is to stick to a player in your current team of support who is most likely to be bought during the transfer window, when such a player is bought then you can reveal the whole idea of  why you have been supporting the team is because you loved the player. In case that player is not bought or is ditched during the transfer window then hang on with us and follow the second procedure.
	Begin by buying shirts of the alternate team and when fellow supporters ask, tell them “supporting arsenal has been my alternate team ” hence simple and convenient.
	Well the third procedure is a bit difficult for people who are not strong cause it could probably get you bitten by other supporters and this is giving them a straight reason that you want to change because the team sucks and you could say “if arsenal does not get  trophies this season then an leaving it for good”  and hence the easy way out but the following are the prerequisites of using this methodology. One must be too courageous  and  strong  as again it could get you bitten as we mentioned earlier.

			\section{Conclusion}

				Swapping to a team of interest is upon you the supporter and it’s your will thus can minimize the chances of losing betting stakes. With our listed methodologies above and their procedures it has never been easier to swap a team.
